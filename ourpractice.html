                <h5>Dr. John R. Tanner</h5>
                <p>Dr. Tanner was born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. During his college years, he spent 2 years in South America serving a mission for his church. Spanish is now a second language. He has been married to his wife for over 20 years and they have 4 wonderful children. They love hiking the various National Parks, visiting museums, and spending time on the lake. Family, church, and community play a big part of their lives.</p>
<p>
For over 15 years, Dr. Tanner has practiced in the best clinics alongside exceptional surgeons. Staying at the forefront of technology and new medical treatments has allowed him to excel as an eye care provider. Over the years he has gained extensive experience in diagnosing and treating glaucoma, macular degeneration, dry eyes, diabetes, removing ocular foreign bodies, and treating numerous other eye-related problems.

He has always taken the time to clearly explain and answer questions thoroughly. Making clinical decisions based upon what is best for the patient has led to great success and made his career enjoyable. Being honest and treating each patient with respect has built his reputation as an eye doctor with integrity. Having happy and satisfied patients is well worth the extra effort put forth on his part.
Service and Leadership In The Community
Dr. Tanner led and encouraged other professionals as President of a local Optometric Society for 7 years. For 10 years he brought more and better education to optometry by being the founder and administrator of Knowledge Outlook, an annual all-day continuing education seminar near the Chicagoland area. Serving the community for 14 years in various capacities with The Boy Scouts of America has given him the opportunity to positively affect the leaders of tomorrow. He has enjoyed 15 years of coaching outdoor and indoor soccer. Dr. Tanner is currently adjunct faculty of Midwestern University Arizona College of Optometry.</p>

                <h5>Dr. Gary Morgan</h5>
                <p>A 1992 graduate of the Illinois College of Optometry, Dr. Gary Morgan opened the practice in 1993.  With a heavy emphasis on medical eye care since inception, Dr. Morgan’s goal has always been to provide cutting-edge technology for the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases, as well as for screening procedures during routine well vision exams.  In fact, the practice name, Eye Tech, illustrates this.  Of particular note:
</p><p>
Glaucoma:  A large portion of Dr. Morgan’s practice is focused on glaucoma care.  A heavy emphasis has been placed on investing in technology for the diagnosis, monitoring, and ongoing treatment needed to effectively treat this disease.
</p><p>
AMD: Age-related Macular Degeneration is a visually devastating disease.  However, new advancements in disease detection and treatment give clinicians using the latest technology an edge in the endeavor to preserve vision for their patients.  Dr. Morgan’s goal for Eye Tech Eye Associates is to stay at the forefront of new developments in diagnosing, monitoring and treating this disease.  In fact, he is one of the first doctors in Arizona to use genetic testing to determine a patient’s risk of disease progression.
</p><p>
Headaches:  Our world is turning digital.  As such, many people are feeling the effects of increased eye strain and headaches.  New technology for alleviating eye strain and headaches is available, and more is on the way.  In fact, many may suffer from debilitating headaches without relief from medications that can be helped with ocular treatment in the form of specialized lenses.
</p><p>
As an early adopter of new technology, Dr. Morgan has written and lectured on the clinical advantages of incorporating technology into optometric practice.  He often provides “behind the scenes” opinions to ophthalmic industry leaders regarding new products and services.  Dr. Morgan’s passion is the preservation of ocular health and providing the resources for patients to make informed decisions on their ocular healthcare needs.</p>

                <h5>Dr. Wellman</h5>
                <p>Dr. Wellman was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. Before beginning college, he served a two-year mission for his church in Russia, where he learned to speak the language.  Upon his return, he did his undergraduate work at Arizona State University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in biological sciences.  Dr. Wellman went on to earn a doctorate degree in optometry from Midwestern University.

Dr. Wellman and his wife have been married for nine years and they have three children.  They enjoy music, movies, the outdoors, and spending time together.

Dr. Wellman completed four ocular disease-focused internships during his optometric training and is passionate about treatment and management of eye diseases, including glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetes.  He constantly strives to continue his education and keep up with the newest developments in eye care.  He believes in using the latest technology and techniques to provide patient care at the highest level.

Dr. Wellman enjoys serving his patients and giving them an eye care experience of professionalism, respect, and kindness.  Whether it is his patients, his family, members of his church or his community, Dr. Wellman loves to help people.</p>
