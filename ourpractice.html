            <h3>Gary Morgan O.D.</h3>
            <p>
              A 1992 graduate of the Illinois College of Optometry, Dr. Gary Morgan opened the practice in 1993. With a heavy emphasis on medical eye care since inception, Dr. Morgan’s goal has always been to provide cutting-edge technology for the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases, as well as for screening procedures during routine well vision exams. In fact, the practice name, Eye Tech, illustrates this. Of particular note:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Glaucoma:</strong> A large portion of Dr. Morgan’s practice is focused on glaucoma care. A heavy emphasis has been placed on investing in technology for the diagnosis, monitoring, and ongoing treatment needed to effectively treat this disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>AMD:</strong> Age-related Macular Degeneration is a visually devastating disease. However, new advancements in disease detection and treatment give clinicians using the latest technology an edge in the endeavor to preserve vision for their patients. Dr. Morgan’s goal for Eye Tech Eye Associates is to stay at the forefront of new developments in diagnosing, monitoring and treating this disease. In fact, he is one of the first doctors in Arizona to use genetic testing to determine a patient’s risk of disease progression.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Headaches:</strong> Our world is turning digital. As such, many people are feeling the effects of increased eye strain and headaches. New technology for alleviating eye strain and headaches is available, and more is on the way. In fact, many may suffer from debilitating headaches without relief from medications that can be helped with ocular treatment in the form of specialized lenses.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an early adopter of new technology, Dr. Morgan has written and lectured on the clinical advantages of incorporating technology into optometric practice. He often provides “behind the scenes” opinions to ophthalmic industry leaders regarding new products and services. Dr. Morgan’s passion is the preservation of ocular health and providing the resources for patients to make informed decisions on their ocular healthcare needs.
